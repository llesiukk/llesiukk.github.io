            <p>Justin Beaver confessed something that even his greatest fans would have never expected of the skilled musicians and lyricist. The young rock-and-roller admitted that since he t',ped his
                first title tag, his life became easier. It has been reported by those surrounding the Canadian that Beaver's private mentors, Ryan Loseling and Nicolas Crate, often walk around Los
                Angeles disputing what a great tool the HTML validator is.</p>
